/**
 * DO NOT provide a method that returns components contained WITHIN the VM (this 
 * is the exact situation that will break encapsulation) - you should request 
 * that the VM performs operations on its components. This implies that the VM 
 * owns the components and is free to change them, as needed, without breaking 
 * clients' code (e.g., suppose I decide to change the name of the variable that 
 * holds my runtime stack - if your code had referenced that variable then your 
 * code would break. This is not an unusual situation - you can consider the 
 * names of methods in the Java libraries that have been deprecated).
 * 
 * Consider that the VM calls the individual ByteCodes' execute method and 
 * passes itself as a parameter. For the ByteCode to execute, it must invoke 
 * one or more methods in the runStack. It can do this by executing 
 * VM.runStack.pop(); however, this does break encapsulation. To avoid this, 
 * you'll need to have a corresponding set of methods within the VM that do 
 * nothing more than pass the call to the runStack. e.g., you would want to 
 * define a VM method:
 *     public int popRunStack() {
 *       return runStack.pop();
 *     }
 * called by, e.g.,
 *     int temp = VM.popRunStack();
